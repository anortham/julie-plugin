# Web Research

Fetch web pages, index them locally, and read selectively using Julie's tools. This replaces dumping entire web pages into context (which wastes thousands of tokens) with a workflow that indexes the content and lets you pull out just the sections you need.

## Prerequisites

browser39 must be installed. Check with:

```bash
which browser39
```

If missing, tell the user to install it:

```bash
cargo install browser39
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch and Save

Determine the target file path from the URL. The directory structure mirrors the URL:

```
docs/web/
  docs.rs/axum/latest.md
  developer.mozilla.org/Web/API/Fetch_API.md
  github.com/tokio-rs/tokio.md
```

Fetch the page and save directly to the target file. Never print full page content to stdout.

```bash
# Fetch
echo '{"id":"1","action":"fetch","v":1,"seq":1,"url":"THE_URL","options":{"selector":"article","strip_nav":true,"include_links":true}}' > /tmp/b39-cmd.jsonl
browser39 batch /tmp/b39-cmd.jsonl --output /tmp/b39-out.jsonl

# Extract markdown directly to file (no stdout leak)
mkdir -p docs/web/TARGET_DOMAIN/TARGET_PATH_DIR
python3 -c "
import sys,json
with open('/tmp/b39-out.jsonl') as f:
    for line in f:
        d=json.loads(line)
        md = d.get('markdown','')
        if md:
            with open('docs/web/TARGET_DOMAIN/TARGET_PATH.md','w') as out:
                out.write(md)
            print(f'Saved {len(md)} chars to docs/web/TARGET_DOMAIN/TARGET_PATH.md')
"
```

If the page content is empty or too short, retry without the `selector` option, or try `"main"`, `".content"`, or `"body"`.

The filewatcher automatically indexes the file within 1-2 seconds.

### Step 2: Explore the Content

See the page structure (table of contents):

```
get_symbols(file_path="docs/web/{domain}/{path}.md", mode="structure")
```

This returns section headings as a hierarchy, letting you see what's on the page without reading it.

### Step 3: Read Selectively

**Read a specific section** by name:

```
get_symbols(file_path="docs/web/{domain}/{path}.md", mode="minimal", target="Section Name")
```

**Search across all fetched pages:**

```
fast_search(query="your search terms", file_pattern="docs/web/**")
```

**Get token-budgeted context** for a concept:

```
get_context(query="concept or question", file_pattern="docs/web/**")
```

### Step 4: Follow Links (Optional)

The fetched markdown contains links. If you need more information, fetch additional pages by repeating Steps 1-2 with the linked URLs. The agent decides which links are worth following based on the research goal.

### Step 5: Clean Up

When research is complete, suggest removing fetched content:

```bash
# Remove a specific page
rm docs/web/{domain}/{path}.md

# Remove all fetched content
rm -rf docs/web/
```

The filewatcher automatically removes deleted files from the index.

## Tips

- **GitHub README pages**: Use `selector: "article"` to get just the README content
- **Documentation sites**: Try `selector: "main"` or `selector: ".content"` to skip navigation
- **Large pages**: Use browser39's `max_tokens` option to limit the fetch, then paginate with `offset`
- **Multiple pages at once**: Write multiple commands to the JSONL file (one per line) for batch fetching
- **Searching across fetched content**: `file_pattern="docs/web/**"` scopes any Julie tool to just the fetched web content
- **Empty results from get_symbols**: The filewatcher indexes within 1-2 seconds. If results are empty, the file may not have been written correctly; check the file exists and has content.
