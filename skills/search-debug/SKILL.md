# Search Debug

Diagnose why a Julie search returns unexpected results. Use this when a search misses an expected symbol, ranks it too low, or returns irrelevant results. This skill is for Julie dogfooding, not general plugin usage.

## Process

### Step 1: Reproduce the Search

Run the exact search the user reported:

```
fast_search(query="<original_query>", limit=20)
```

`fast_search` returns mixed-kind results; each hit carries `kind`. Note what comes back, the top results, their scores, and what's missing. If the default response says "No lexical results. Showing semantic fallback candidates.", treat that as a semantic rescue, not a lexical hit.

If the report involves backend behavior, run the exact requested backend and compare `backend="lexical"`, `backend="semantic"`, and `backend="hybrid"`. Explicit lexical stays pure lexical for bakeoffs; semantic and hybrid are symbol-only concept search.

### Step 2: Verify the Expected Symbol Exists

Search for the expected symbol directly:

```
fast_search(query="<expected_symbol_name>")
```

If it doesn't appear at all, the symbol may not be indexed.

### Step 3: Check Index Health

```
manage_workspace(operation="health", detailed=true)
```

Look for:
- Is the workspace indexed?
- Are there indexing errors?
- Is the file containing the expected symbol in the indexed file list?

### Step 4: Deep Dive the Expected Symbol

```
deep_dive(symbol="<expected_symbol>", depth="context")
```

Check:
- **Centrality**: Low-centrality symbols get less boost in search results. Symbols with no references won't benefit from centrality boosting. Use `get_context` to see the centrality label (low/medium/high).
- **Symbol kind**: Is it a function, struct, variable? Variables and constants may score differently.
- **File path**: Is it in a test/docs/fixture path? Docs/tests get `NL_PATH_PENALTY_DOCS` / `NL_PATH_PENALTY_TESTS` (0.95x); fixture paths get a steeper `NL_PATH_PENALTY_FIXTURES` (0.75x).
- **Name shape**: Does the symbol name break into the tokens the query implies?

### Step 5: Analyze Scoring Factors

Consider why the expected result might score lower than competitors:

**Tokenization issues:**
- Does the query tokenize to match the symbol? Julie's `CodeTokenizer` splits CamelCase and snake_case — `getUserData` becomes `[get, user, data]`, `get_user_data` also becomes `[get, user, data]`.
- Are there prefix/suffix stripping rules in the language config that might affect matching?
- Does the query contain words that stem differently? (English stemming: "running" → "run")

**Ranking issues:**
- Is a different symbol with higher centrality stealing the top spot? High-centrality symbols get a logarithmic boost.
- Is the expected symbol in a test file? Test-path symbols get a mild penalty for natural-language queries.
- Is the expected symbol in a docs or fixture path that gets a prior penalty?

**Index issues:**
- Was the file recently added? It may need re-indexing: `manage_workspace(operation="refresh")`
- Is the symbol in a language Julie doesn't extract well?

### Step 6: Report

```
Search Debug: "<query>"
Expected: <symbol_name> (<file>:<line>)

Current Results (top 5):
  1. <symbol> (<file>) — why it scores high
  2. <symbol> (<file>) — why it scores high
  ...

Expected Symbol Analysis:
  Centrality: <high/medium/low>
  Kind: <function/struct/etc>
  Visibility: <pub/private>
  File path: <path> (production/test/docs)

Diagnosis:
  <Root cause — one of: tokenization mismatch, centrality gap, path penalty,
   not indexed, wrong symbol kind, or genuinely correct ranking>

Scoring Factors at Play:
  - Centrality boost: <applies/doesn't apply>
  - NL path prior: <docs/tests penalty, fixtures penalty, or neutral>
  - Tokenization: query "<query>" → tokens [<tokens>], symbol "<name>" → tokens [<tokens>]
  - Index state: <current/stale/missing>

Recommendation:
  <What to fix — scoring bug, tokenizer config, or "ranking is correct">
```

## Important Notes

- **Not every "missing" result is a bug**. If the query is ambiguous, the correct result may rank lower than a more central symbol with the same name.
- **Check tokenization first**. Most search misses come from query tokens that do not line up with symbol-name tokens.
- **Centrality is intentional**. Well-connected symbols ranking higher is a feature, not a bug. Flag it only when the centrality score looks wrong.
- **Cross-workspace**: Call `manage_workspace(operation="open", path="<path>")` first, then pass the returned `workspace_id` to all tool calls
